## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

![Options](https://github.com/Starexify/Starexify/blob/main/resources/BadHUD/BadHUD-Options.png?raw=true)

Explanation for each:

-Show Judgements On Left - Just shows the Judgements (Sick, Good, Bad etc) in the left side of the screen

-Show Timer - Shows the time elapsed of the song in down-center of the screen

-Vertical Health Bar - Moves the Health Bar in right side of the screen

-Vertical Score Bar - Moves the Score in the left side of the screen (also adds combo counter)

(Look at mod images for better example of how they look)

- Accuracy - There are 3 accuracy types (Vanilla, Psych Engine, osu!mania) with each different methods of calculation

The calculations for accuracy are:

n = the total of notes in a chart
